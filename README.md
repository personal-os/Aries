##### Note: I am developing Aries on Mac OS X. If you would like to test/use Aries on your platform of choice, you can first download and unzip this repo to your computer, download the latest node-webkit binary [for your system](http://dl.nwjs.io), drop it in the `code` directory, and double-click it.

Please let me know if you find issues for your system.

For updates on [hikari](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/hikari) and [Aries](https://github.com/IdeasNeverCease/Aries), you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TadashiHikari). I will continue to try and provide regular updates to these projects, but you know how life goes.

# Tips

* Typing `aries://about` or `aries://credits` in the URL bar will give you some more information about the browser.
* Hovering links will *not* make an unsightly status bar appear with the link inside. Instead, this is done in the URL bar! Sometimes gets stuck, but it's mostly okay (like, 99.8%).
