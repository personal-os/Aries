##### Note: I have included the node-webkit binaries for both Windows and Mac, for the time being. Whichever your platform, go into that folder and run nw.exe/nw.app.

##### <del>Uhhh, figure out how to run node-webkit for your system.</del> A fleshed out readme will be available later (as well as binaries for Linux and Windows), when Aries hits 1.0. For now, you can download the latest node-webkit binary [for your system](http://dl.node-webkit.org), drop it in the root directory of this repo, and double-click on it.
